# DevSecOps Awareness – Part 1  

**Why Security in Development and Delivery Matters for Everyone**

---

## 1. Opening: Change the Perspective

**Slide Title:** *“What comes to mind when you hear ‘cyberattack’?”*  

- Common answers: servers, passwords, hackers in hoodies.  
- **Reality check:** Attacks are shifting.  
  > Today, the battleground is not just production systems – it’s the development process itself.

---

## 2. The Big Picture

**Slide Title:** *“From Production to Pipeline”*  

- Traditional security focus: Protecting assets in production.  
- New reality:  
  - Automated delivery pipelines (CI/CD) are now part of the attack surface.  
  - Open-source dependencies can be the weakest link.  
  - Supply chain attacks are growing fast.  

**Analogy:**  
> “If we only secure the finished house but ignore the building materials, we risk rotten walls.”

## 3. Why Attackers Target Development

**Slide Title:** *“Why Development Is Attractive”*  

- **Automation = Scale:** One compromised step can infect hundreds of systems.  
- **Trust = Vulnerability:** We trust third-party libraries and vendors.  
- **Example:** Recent supply chain attacks spread globally in hours.

## 4. Consequences for Organizations

**Slide Title:** *“What’s at Stake?”*  

- Loss of source code and secrets (API keys, tokens).  
- Downtime and costly recovery.  
- Reputation damage and compliance risks.  

---

## 5. Why Everyone Should Care

**Slide Title:** *“Not Just an IT Problem”*  

- Security is a business issue, not just a technical one.  
- Every role matters:  
  - Decision-makers must include software supply chain in risk management.  
  - Procurement must evaluate vendor security practices.  
  - Users must understand why updates and controls matter.

---

## 6. Engaging the Audience

**Slide Title:** *“Let’s Think About This…”*  

- Question: *“What happens if a single library we use is compromised?”*  
- Visual: A simple diagram of the software lifecycle with risk points highlighted.  
- Story: A real-world example of a supply chain attack (without deep technical detail).

## 7. Closing & Bridge to Part Two

**Slide Title:** *“Expanding Our Security Horizon”*  

- Key takeaway:  
  > “We must move beyond securing production systems. Security must cover the entire software lifecycle – from code to delivery.”  
- Teaser for next part:  
  > “In Part Two, we’ll dive into how these attacks actually work and explore practical steps to protect our pipelines and dependencies.”

### **Tone Tips**

- Keep language simple and relatable.
- Use analogies and visuals to make abstract concepts concrete.
- End with a strong call to curiosity: *“How do attackers exploit these pipelines? Let’s find out in Part Two.”*
